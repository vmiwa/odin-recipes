        <h4 class="recipedescription">The Denver omelet is a change of pace from a French omelet and is known for its firmer texture and caramelized flavor. It's one of the first foods I learned to cook professionally as a line cook in high school. Make it a complete lunch or dinner with arugula salad and toasted bread.</h4>
        <h5>Ingredients:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> 3 large ones</li>
                <li><strong>Butter: </strong> one tablespoon</li>
                <li><strong>Smoked Ham:</strong> ¼ cup diced</li>
                <li><strong>Diced Onion:</strong> 2 tablespoons</li>
                <li><strong>Green Bell Pepper:</strong> 2 tablespoons, diced</li>
                <li><strong>Cheddar Cheese:</strong> ⅓ cup shredded</li>
                <li><strong>Cayenne Pepper:</strong> 1 pinch</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Steps:</h5>    
            <ol>
                <li>Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined; do not overbeat.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham, onion, and bell pepper; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until onions soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes. </li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula while shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed. Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelet. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper over omelet.</li>
                <li>Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet but not runny, about 5 minutes. Use a spatula to fold omelet in half and transfer it to a plate.</li>
            </ol>
